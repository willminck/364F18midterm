My Midterm Project allows for a user to enter a company's Name, Stock Symbol, and Industry. I used the IEX Trading API to retrieve current market pricing for a share in that company's stock. There are three different view functions that show all the companies, stocks, and industries entered by the user. Additionally, a user can enter some fun facts he/she knows about a company, and the app will return a succint display of the information.
